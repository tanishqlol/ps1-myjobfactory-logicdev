# Resumeâ€“Job Matching System

This project aims to build an intelligent matchmaking system that connects job seekers with relevant job opportunities based on their resume, skills, and personal work style â€” not just keywords.

## Project Goals

- Parse resumes to extract structured information (skills, experience, education).
- Enrich candidate profiles using data from GitHub, LinkedIn, and personal websites.
- Process free-text persona descriptions to understand preferred work styles.
- Represent both candidate and job data as vector embeddings using lightweight NLP models (e.g., GloVe, FastText).
- Match candidates to job listings using similarity search or neural networks.
- Build a working prototype for candidate-to-job matchmaking.
